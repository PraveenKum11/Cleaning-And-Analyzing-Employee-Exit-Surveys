# Cleaning And Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys From Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia  

* This is a Guided Project form DataQuest.

* In this project I have cleaned and analyzed the Employee Exit Surveys  
Below are some conclusions I came up with :-

# Conclusions :-  
### Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* As we can see from the graph(refer to the notebook file) that people from every age group seem to dissatisfied, in which Established and Veterans seem to most dissatisfied and the new group is least dissatified.

### Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
* Clearly new group is the least dissatisfied or most satisfied among the other groups so **No** they are not leaving due to dissatisfaction, but the older groups(ie-Vetrans and Established) are probably resigning due to dissatisfaction.
